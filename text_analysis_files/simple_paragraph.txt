I will be using this file to get the complete text analysis later on, but for now my task is to 
get the word count, character count and other statistics about a simple text.
I am trying it all for myself.
Later-on, I will be following the ruby programming book to make a complete text analyzer that can be used 
to analyze any kind of text file.
I believe that advancement come in any language but it takes some time. None can get advancement over night.
Patience is required for such kind of achievement.
Now, I am adding more in it
